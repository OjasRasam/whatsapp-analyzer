Every event has a unique story that teaches us something new. One of those is our industrial visit. Even though there were some unavoidable challenges during this activity, we overcame them all as a team to accomplish our goal. All of the students' enthusiasm is appreciated. 
I may add that we discovered a few "Success Mantras" that will help us to plan the new activity in the future.


I am thankful to Priydarshini Madam and her Faculty team (Lady Warriors of the Industrial Visit) as well as Student Coordinators (Soldiers) for making me and Manish Sir a part of this event.


In conclusion, your care and affection triggered faculty members to turn out to be strict sometimes, so I request that we hold all these items apart and begin over.


सर्वात शेवटी, येणाऱ्या गुढी पाडव्याच्या आणि नव वर्षाच्या तुम्हाला हार्दिक शुभेच्छा.


Thanks & Regards,
Ganesh Mhatre Sir

07/04/24, 10:43 pm - Priyadarshi Madam: Thank you very much Sir for your thoughtful message. I hope all members of the Industrial Visit have indeed reached home timely and safely.
Your reflections on our industrial visit are deeply appreciated. Thank you so much for your support and help. Indeed, every event carries its own unique lessons in IV. 
The dedication displayed by coordinators were truly praiseworthy. 
It is regrettable that despite our best efforts, there were instances where things did not go as smoothly as planned. Despite any obstacles that came our way, all students showed positive attitude and willingness to adjust to changing circumstances was appreciable.
I'm grateful for your kind words and acknowledgment of the efforts put in by the faculty team, along with the student coordinators.
Wish you very happy Gudhi Padwa and the New Year. May it bring prosperity, happiness, and success to all.
