We are planning to conduct an industrial visit next month and I want majority of you to join in thus needed everyone's poll on the budget for IV , we have two options :
1. Budget will go upto 5 k per person and we will be going out of station for a day or two and this will include stay accommodation and food provisions. 
2. We can have a single day IV to a nearby tech company office space where we can observe how they operate in the corporate world . Here the budget can go upto 1 k or 1.5k  but we will be going and returning on the same day .
Thus I'll be posting a poll down here and I need to see what interests you all and give your RSVPs please . The trip will be next month last week (tentatively).
